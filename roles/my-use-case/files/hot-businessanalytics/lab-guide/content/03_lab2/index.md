This lab will help you understand what business analytics is trying to achieve for an end goal.

### 3.1 Finding your journey flow

1.	*Open* "**Notebooks**"
1.	*Create* a **new notebook**
1.	*Click* on the "**+**" to add a **new section**
1.	*Click* on "**DQL**"
1.	Copy and *paste* the *query*:

      ```
      Fetch Bizevents
      | filter isNotNull(rsBody) and isNotNull(rqBody)
      | filter isNotNull(json.additionalFields) and isNotNull(json.stepIndex)
      | filter json.companyName == "Companyname" //Include your companyName in "" from the BizObs app
      | summarize count(), by:{event.type,json.stepName, json.stepIndex}
      | sort json.stepIndex asc
      ```

1. This DQL will show you the order of your Customer Journey in a simple context. The journey is from StepIndex 1 > 6, and can include exceptions where applicable

      **CustomerName** Journey Flow
      ```
